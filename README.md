## My Process 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- **Responsive Design**:

  I learned how to create a responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries. Flexbox helped me easily align and distribute elements within the card, while media queries allowed me to adjust the layout based on different screen sizes, making the card suitable for both mobile and desktop devices.

- **Hover Effects and Interactivity**:

  I discovered how to implement hover effects using CSS. By changing the color of the title on hover and adding a pointer cursor, I made the card more interactive and visually engaging, giving users clear feedback when they interact with the card.

- **Version Control with Git**:

  Through this project, I practiced using Git for version control. I created commits, pushed changes to GitHub, and set up a GitHub Pages   demo to showcase the final product. This process helped reinforce best practices for managing code in a collaborative environment.

- **Project Deployment**:

  I learned how to deploy a project online using GitHub Pages, making it publicly accessible for others to view and use. This process was a great learning experience for understanding how to share projects with the community.
